Sand's article in Fate described the area as "a watery triangle bounded roughly by Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico".[7]: 12  The Argosy article by Gaddis further delineated the boundaries,[12] giving its vertices as Miami, San Juan, and Bermuda. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.[19] Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 1.3 to 3.9 million km2 (0.50 to 1.51 million sq mi).[19] "Indeed, some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast," according to a 1977 BBC program.[2] Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.
